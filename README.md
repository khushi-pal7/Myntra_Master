# 🛍️ **Myntra AI Hackathon – Smart Shopping Assistant**

## 📌 **Overview**
This project was built as part of the **Myntra Hackathon 2025**.  
It was originally cloned from 👉 [Myntra Clone by vikasdev8](https://github.com/vikasdev8/MyntraClone) and the dataset was taken from  👉 [ronakbokaria/myntra-products-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronakbokaria/myntra-products-dataset)  
This contains product metadata (names, categories, images, prices) that helps bootstrap product catalogue, embeddings, and recommendation engines.
We have extended the minimal non-functional clone with **AI-powered features** to transform e-commerce experiences with **personalisation, trust, and decision-making support**.

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**
Shoppers face three key challenges in online fashion:  
- **Lack of peer influence** – friends’ opinions are missing in product discovery.  
- **Overwhelming reviews** – customers struggle to extract useful insights.  
- **Decision fatigue** – comparing wishlist items is tedious and leads to drop-offs.

## 🚀 **Our Solution – 3 Features**

### 1️⃣ **Social Circle Recommendations**
- **What it is**: Hyper-personalised product feed powered by a user’s close connections.  
- **How it works**: Builds a **social graph** from selected friends (min. 10–20 for privacy), merges it with **browsing history & style preferences**, and shows **socially validated recommendations**.  
- **Impact**: Boosts trust, improves discovery, and increases CTR & conversions.  

**Tech Used & Why**  
- **SentenceTransformers** → generate embeddings for similarity between users & products.  
- **CLIP** → align product images with textual metadata for richer matching.
- **BERT**→ sequence-to-sequence model designed for both understanding and text generation, so as to sort out the similar items for recommendation. 
- **MongoDB (Friendship Graph)** → store user-friend connections securely.

### 2️⃣ **AI Review Summarization**
- **What it is**: An AI component that condenses hundreds of reviews into a simple **“Loved vs Found Issues”** summary.  
- **How it works**: Uses **BAART for summarization + **sentiment analysis** to highlight top positives & negatives.  
- **Impact**: Reduces decision uncertainty, builds confidence, and shortens product evaluation time.  

**Tech Used & Why**  
- **BERT** → strong at sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative).  
- **MongoDB (Reviews Collection)** → store review text and embeddings for retrieval.

### 3️⃣ **Wishlist Contrast Engine**
- **What it is**: A smart **comparison assistant** for wishlist items.  
- **How it works**: Uses **embeddings & contextual recommendation** to auto-compare items (price, fit, delivery, reviews) and highlight best-value picks.  
- **Impact**: Speeds up decision-making, lowers cart drop-offs, and drives conversions.  

**Tech Used & Why**  
-**BERT**→ Built an intelligent wishlist comparison system using SBERT to perform semantic similarity matching between products, overcoming limitations of traditional keyword-based approaches.
- **Custom Embeddings** → represent product attributes for better contextual comparisons.  
- **Hybrid Scoring (Rules + ML)** → combine business logic (price, delivery) with AI (preferences).  
- **React (UI)** → dynamic comparison modal with highlights of best picks.
